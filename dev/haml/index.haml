					%p In late 2014, ModBox purchased the former St.Charles Church with the intention of reviving the historic property and edifice. A well-known and beloved anchor within its community, our vision for this development is to protect and preserve the church building, while celebrating the potential of what it is and what it can become.

					%p As we continue to progress with all of the the necessary approvals for the project, our goal is to provide a mixed-use project that will act as a central hub for the community. Composed of both residential and commercial elements, the former St. Charles Church will include condominiums, townhouses, workplaces, restaurants and a seasonal marketplace to its centrally-located site.

					%p This new site will be a destination not only for local area residents but also for people from other communities in Ottawa and visitors to the city from around the world.
